# Index Compliant Prototype

This is a prototype for a Index cable holder inspired by compliant mechanism.

- This prototype has some vestigial design from another prototype that uses 3D printed hinges
- It was inspired by Mark Rober's video on a compliant mechanism Nerf gun (posted 4 days before this)

How to print:
- This print needs tree supports on the build plate to support the V-shaped portion of the print.
- The other portion of the print does not need supports, so you may put a support blocker in that area.
